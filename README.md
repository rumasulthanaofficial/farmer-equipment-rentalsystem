## 🔁 Connection Between Frontend and Backend

In this Django-powered application:

- **Frontend**: The part users interact with—web pages, forms, buttons, etc.
- **Backend**: The logic layer—processes requests, manages data, and handles business rules.

**Django bridges the frontend and backend** by:
- Receiving user actions (e.g., bookings)
- Processing and validating them on the backend
- Fetching or updating the database
- Sending updated data back to the frontend

This ensures a seamless, real-time experience for users.
